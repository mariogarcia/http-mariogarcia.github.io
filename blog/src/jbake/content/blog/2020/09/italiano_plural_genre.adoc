== Basic rules

There're a few rules to know how to construct plural in italian depending on the ending of the singular form. I'm probably missing some rule but in general we've got:

.basic rules
[.centered]
|===
| singular | plural | example
|    -a     |   -e | amica -> amice (friend f.)
|    -o     |   -i | zaino -> zaini (bagpack)
|    -e     |   -i | stazione -> stazioni (station)
|===

Here you have some examples following these rules:

.examples
[.centered]
|===
| singular | plural | meaning
| ospedale | ospedali | hospital
| cassa | casse | house/home
| matita | matite | pencil
| panino | panini | sandwich
| penna | penne | pastry
| pizza | pizze | pizza
| piazza | piazze | square
| povero | poveri | poor
| quaderno | quaderni | notebook
| sieda | siede | chair
| spiaggia | spiaggie | beach
|===

== Foreign words

In general foreign words are the same in both singular and plural.

== Adding h

Finally there're some exceptions to the basic rules. These exceptions try to keep the sonority that the singular form had.

.h rules
[.centered]
|===
| singular | plural | example
| -ca | -che | amica -> amiche
| -ga | -ghe | ruga -> rughe
|===

When ending with **-go** depends. If it's related to a person the the plural ends with **gi** as in **biologo -> biologi**:

.ending with -go
[.centered]
|===
| singular | plural | example
| -go | -gui | albergo -> alberghi
| -go | -gi | biologo -> biologi
|===

The same goes with **-co**. Depending on whether the letter before **co** is a vowel or a consonant, the plural will be different.

.ending with -co (cont.)
[.centered]
|===
| singular | plural | example
| -[vowel]co | chi| parco -> parchi
| -[conso]co | ci | medico -> medici
|===

== Must-know exceptions

Finally there're some must-know exceptions worth learning:

.important exceptions
[.centered]
|===
| singular | plural | meaning
| uomo | uomini | man
| dito | dita | finger
| uovo | uova | egg
| braccio | braccia | arm
|===

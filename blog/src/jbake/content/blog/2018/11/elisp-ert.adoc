== Intro

In the past few weeks I've been working on a small project to get used
to elisp programming, and I got to a point when I needed to make sure
I wasn't breaking anything in the process. There're several solutions
out there but the first I put my hands on was
https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ert/index.html[ERT].

=== What is ERT ?

"ERT is a tool for automated testing in Emacs Lisp. Its main features
are facilities for defining tests, running them and reporting the
results, and for debugging test failures interactively."
-- ERT main page

=== Writing a buggy function

In order to show how ERT works, I'm creating a buggy function. The
function is supposed to sort a list of strings in ascending order by
default. But in fact it returns by default the strings in descending
order.

[source, elisp]
.sort list tests
----
include::{sources}/elisp-ert-ko.el[tags=incorrect]
----

=== Writing tests

In order to make sure the function does what it claims to do, we
should write a test. An ERT test normally looks like the following:

[source, elisp]
.basic form
----
(ert-deftest name-of-the-test ()
             (should ...)) ;; assertions
----

An ERT test uses the macro `ert-deftest` to declare a new test. Then
it uses `should` to check assertions results. There're more
possibilities other than `should`: `should-not` or `should-error`. I'm
talking about them a little bit later.

[source, elisp]
.sort list tests
----
include::{sources}/elisp-ert-ko.el[tags=incorrect_test]
----
<1> Tests default sort (ascending) by string length
<2> Tests descending sort by string length

=== Executing tests

You can execute ERT test in different ways, but the one I prefer is
batch execution via command line. Is the one I think I would use in a
CI environmnet.

NOTE: Of course, you will have to install Emacs in your CI environment
in order to be able to execute these tests.

[source, shell]
.shell execution
----
emacs -batch -l ert -l /path/to/file_containing_tests.el -f ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit
----

And because I've made a mistake with the default sorting this is what I got:

[source, shell]
.test output
----
Running 2 tests (2018-11-18 16:08:14+0100)
   passed  1/2  test-sort-by-default

        '...))
      :form
      (equal
       ("a" "aa" "aaa") ;; <1>
       ("aaa" "aa" "a")) ;; <2>
      :value nil :explanation
      (list-elt 0
                (arrays-of-different-length 1 3 "a" "aaa" first-mismatch-at 1))))
   FAILED  2/2  test-sort-by-desc

Ran 2 tests, 1 results as expected, 1 unexpected (2018-11-18 16:08:14+0100)

1 unexpected results:
   FAILED  test-sort-by-desc
----
<1> Expected
<2> Actual result

=== Asserts with should

ERT provides different macros to help you make your tests easier to
read and understand. The most common is `should`.

[source, elisp]
.should
----
include::{sources}/elisp-ert-should.el[tags=asserts-should]
----

Sometimes you may want to assert that the result is not what is
expected, for example to assert that the division operation is not
commutative. For that you can use `should-not`:

[source, elisp]
.should-not
----
include::{sources}/elisp-ert-should.el[tags=asserts-should-not]
----

And I'm sure that at some point, you'll need to assert that some
function is throwing an error under some circumstances. In that case
you can use `should-error`:

[source, elisp]
.should-error
----
include::{sources}/elisp-ert-should.el[tags=asserts-should-error]
----

In this example I'm checking that the function throws an error and
also that error is of type *'singularity-error*.

NOTE: `:type` is optional

=== Fixing function

Now it's time to do the fix and make the test pass.

[source, elisp]
----
include::{sources}/elisp-ert-ok.el[tags=correct]
----

Running tests again shows the following output:

[source, elisp]
----
Running 2 tests (2018-11-18 16:38:00+0100)
   passed  1/2  test-sort-by-default
   passed  2/2  test-sort-by-desc

Ran 2 tests, 2 results as expected (2018-11-18 16:38:00+0100)
----

Now everything works as expected

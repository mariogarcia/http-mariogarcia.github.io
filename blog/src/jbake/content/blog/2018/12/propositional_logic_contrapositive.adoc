Just a quick note about the `contrapositive` is that it's very useful
to prove some statement. For example:

"All drivers in Madrid, drive a bike"
-- original statement

[mathx, width=100, height=120]
----
A \implies B
----

Now if we can prove that the *contrapositive* is true, then we can
prove that the original statement was wrong.

"All non-bike drivers, live outside Madrid"
-- contrapositive

[mathx, width=100, height=120]
----
\neg B \implies \neg A
----

Only proving that at leat one non-bike driver lives in Madrid will
prove the initial statement to be wrong.

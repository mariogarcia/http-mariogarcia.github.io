Very interesting talk, but a little bit hard to follow. Many theoric
knowledge for the very first talk, my brain almost melted.

In the first have of the session they started talking about the basics
of distributed computacion reviewing technologies such as Hadoop and
the `map-reduce` approach, and how it gives you a way of providing the
following principles in a distributed computation environment:

- `Parallelization`
- `Data Distribution`
- `Fault Tolerance`

Once the basics were introduced, then they started talking about
Apache Spark. The most important things they highlighted from Spark as
opposed as Hadoop:

- Embraces the `functional paradigm`
- Uses `lazy computations`
- It can `cache` many computations to keep a minimum memory footprint

In the second half the session was all about `Machine Learning` using
`Spark`.  Special mention for the `Notebook` application which is a
web interface on top of Spark that makes a lot easier to start playing
with Spark.

The rest of the session was a sequence of examples using Spark +
Notebook + Machine Learning techniques to show how easy was to solve
some problems using these tools.

==== 13:30 - 16:30 Java 8 Stream and RxJava comparison: patterns and performances

Speaker: Jose Paumard https://twitter.com/@JosePaumard

I have to admit that Mr Paumard looks like the younger brother of
Anthony Hopkins. Jokes aside, Mr Paumard gave a great talk about JDK 8
Streams API and the RxJava library.

The first part of the session was fully dedicated to the Streams API.

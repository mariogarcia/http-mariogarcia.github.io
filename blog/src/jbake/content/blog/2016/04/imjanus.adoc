Today I've moved all my Frege projects to my usual account.

Some time ago, I created another account
https://github.com/januslynd[Janus Lynd] for playing with the
http://frege-lang.com[Frege] programming language. The thing is that
my initial experiments have last like a year and have been really
rewarding, like https://github.com/fregelab/chinook[Chinook] and
https://github.com/fregelab/chinook[Sirocco], but now it has become
really a problem to maintain both accounts, specially because it makes
no sense.
I've sent a message to the Frege mailing list explaining what happened
and I've moved all Frege related projects to
https://github.com/fregelab[FregeLab] and the rest to my account. I
think is a lesson learned.

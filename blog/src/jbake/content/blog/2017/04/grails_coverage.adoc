== Intro

Last http://greachconf.com[Greach] I had the oportunity to talk to
https://twitter.com/sdelamo[@sdelamo] and
https://twitter.com/jeffscottbrown[@jeffbrown] about the behavior of
existing code coverage tools with Grails 3.

=== Tools

It's sad but the truth is there're not so many open source code
coverage tools out there. I guess the most popular in the JVM world
are cobertura and jacoco.

==== Cobertura

[quote, http://cobertura.github.io/cobertura/]
Cobertura is a free Java tool that calculates the percentage of code
accessed by tests. It can be used to identify which parts of your Java
program are lacking test coverage. It is based on jcoverage.

==== Jacoco

[quote, http://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/]
JaCoCo is a free code coverage library for Java, which has been
created by the EclEmma team based on the lessons learned from using
and integration existing libraries for many years.

=== Project

The structure of the project used as example is a gradle multimodule
with the following modules:

[ditaa, "2017/04/grails_coverage/project-modules-diagram", "png", align=center, indent=0]
----
grails_coverage-+
                |
                +----> api
                |
                +----> common
----

- `api`: Grails 3.2.4 application
- `common`: Groovy 2.4.10 library for common utilities

=== Initial configuration

First you have to add both plugins to Gradle configuration in your
file `build.gradle`:

[source, groovy]
.cobertura
----
include::{sources}/gradle/cobertura.gradle[tags=applyCobertura, indent=0]
----

[source, groovy]
.jacoco
----
include::{sources}/gradle/jacoco.gradle[tags=applyJacoco, indent=0]
----

NOTE: Jacoco is bundled with Gradle, and it has a default version. You
can change the Jacoco version. Check oficial Jacoco/Gradle documentation
at https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/jacoco_plugin.html

Now you can execute `cobertura` and `jacoco`.

[source, groovy]
.execute cobertura
----
./gradlew :api:cobertura
----

[source, groovy]
.execute jacoco
----
./gradlew :api:check :api:jacocoTestReport
----

In order to save time and execute both tools one after the other
there's a task (thanks to https://twitter.com/sdelamo[@sdelamo]) that
execute both sequentially:

[source, groovy]
.codeCoverage task
----
include::{sources}/build.gradle[tags=codeCoverage, indent=0]
----

Therefore from now on, I'll do:

[source, groovy]
.execute both
----
./gradlew codeCoverage
----

=== Reducing the noise

Sometimes when creating a new project there are classes that are part
of the framework that we rarerly consider to test. But if we don't
test them they could ruin our coverage reports, even though we're sure
they won't affect the application behavior.

WARNING: Please note that's under your responsibility to decide which
classes are eligible to be tested or not. As a rule of thumb I would
say that if you have doubts about it, you should test it.

==== Omiting classes

In order to get rid of classes we know for sure we don't want to
touch, or we think it doesn't make sense to test, we can tell
**cobertura** and **jacoco** to omit them from their reports.

==== Omiting classes with cobertura

Before showing how to omit those clases, I need to mention that all
cobertura related configuration will be included in the `cobertura {
}` scope inside the `:api` module, `build.gradle` file:

[source, groovy]
.Cobertura configuration
----
cobertura {
  // cobertura configuration here
}
----

Ok, now, in order to tell cobertura to omit classes like `Application` or
`UrlMappings`...etc we use the property `coverageExcludes`:

[source, groovy]
.Adding classes exclusions
----
include::{sources}/gradle/cobertura.gradle[tags=coverageExcludes, indent=0]
----

If we execute the cobertura report again, we'll see that the excluded
classes don't appear anymore.

[source, groovy]
.Executing cobertura
----
./gradlew :api:cobertura
----

==== Omiting classes with jacoco

Well if you take a look at the documentation, you will find that the
configuration attribute `excludes` can exclude classes from
**jacoco**. But it seems what you're really doing is excluding the
class from the report but not from the analysis.

NOTE: This part has been taken from this post:
https://liviutudor.com/2016/02/11/jacoco-gradle-excluding-source-files-and-classes

In order to exclude a give class from both the analysis and the report
you need to add the following to your **jacoco** configuration file in
the `build.gradle` file of the `:api` module.

Inside the jacocoReport configuration:

[source, groovy]
.Jacoco report configuration
----
jacocoTestReport {
  //...
}
----

Add inside the following:

[source, groovy]
.Excluding classes
----
include::{sources}/gradle/jacoco.gradle[tags=excludeClassesJacoco, indent=0]
----

And then jacoco:

[source, groovy]
.Running cobertura
----
./gradlew :api:check :api:jacocoReport
----

Now I got rid of the noise and I can focus on the classes that are
really important to my application.

=== A simple controller

This is a simple greetings controller. It receives a `name` and an
`age` from a `PersonCommand` command object, and eventually it will
return a greetings message.

[source, groovy]
.Greetings controller
----
include::{sources}/api/grails-app/controllers/api/GreetingsController.groovy[indent=0]
----

Next I'll create a simple test checking one possible successful
condition, in order to get some code coverage metrics.

[source, groovy]
.Greetings controller Spec
----
include::{sources}/api/src/test/groovy/api/GreetingsControllerSpec.groovy[tags=successful_message, indent=0]
----

Now I'm running both `cobertura` and `jacoco` to see how covered my code is:

[source, groovy]
.Running cobertura
----
./gradlew :api:cobertura
----

And then jacoco:

[source, groovy]
.Running cobertura
----
./gradlew :api:check :api:jacocoReport
----

.Naive test coverage

a| image::2017/04/grails_coverage/jacoco_greetings_first.png[link="http://mariogarcia.github.io/blog/img/2017/04/grails_coverage/jacoco_greetings_first.png"]
|===

Lets see the metrics.

[options="header"]
.line coverage over GreetingsController.groovy
|===
| _         | line coverage                      | branch coverage
| cobertura |   42% covered                      |  18% covered
| jacoco    |   missed 4/7 => covered 3/7 (42%)  |  25% covered (based on instructions)
|===

- **Line coverage**: If we check both reports it seems that in both
reports line coverage remains the same. But due the fact that Jacoco
shows percentages based on instructions makes harder to get line
coverage metrics.
- **Branch coverage**: Both differ mainly because I think Jacoco
considers instructions instead of full statements.

NOTE: The number in parenthesis is the number of checks done by the
coverage tool in that line

NOTE: I really encourage everybody to take a look at the section:
http://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/counters.html[Coverage
counters] to have a hint on how Jacoco create its metrics.

All sum up 16 possible checks.  Although it seems both tools are
considering the same branches both try to show opposite views of the
same event. Whereas cobertura highlights the branches covered, jacoco
informs about the missing covered branches. What do I prefer ? As long
as I understand what they're describing I'm fine with both approaches
because so far, both tools are giving me the same information about my
code coverage.

Still:

- One thing I'm **missing from Jacoco report** is that in Cobertura's
class detailed view you have a progress bar that gives you a quick
hint about the whole class. Jacoco doesn't have that.
- **Jacoco is showing all Grails generated code** and takes it under
consideration for the general report. That's a lot of code I don't
need to know about, and definitely I don't want to be testing.

NOTE: While Cobertura gives you an easy way to omit certain code at
method level Jacoco still doesn't have that. You can find the
discussion about this at
https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco/wiki/FilteringOptions

=== Next step: `Nail line coverage`

NOTE: I really encourage everybody to take a look at the section:

=== Omicron or Big-O (&#x039F;)

The Big-O sets the *upper limit of a given function f(n)*. The set of
functions &#x039F;(g(n)) is all f(n) functions defined by:

[mathx, height=50]
----
0 \leq f(n) \leq c \times g(n), \forall{n} \geq n_0
----

Which basically means that, given `n~0~`, c * g(n) it's always greater
equals than f(n). It's supposed to be it's upper limit. To demostrate
that a given function is in the set of functions of `&#x039F;(g(n))`:

[mathx, height=50]
----
f(n) \in \omicron(g(n))
----

It will be neccessary to find any pair of values for `c > 0` and `n~0~
> 0` in order to prove that:

[mathx, height=50]
----
f(n) \leq cn, \forall{n} \geq n_0
----

"Demostrate that *6n + 2 &#x2208; &#x039F;(n)*"
-- example

- Step *1*: To find the right `c` constant
- Step *2*: To find `n > 0` so that `6n + 2 &#x2264; cn`
- It's enough to find two possible values. For instance, a possible
*solution* could be: `c = 6` it's valid for all `n &#x2265; 2`,
therefore we can use `n~0~ = 2`

=== About Packer

Packer is an open source tool for creating identical machine images for multiple 
platforms from a single source configuration. One of the worst things I
have to do when creating a new VM is to go through the installation process
as I were doing it in a physical machine. Imagine if you had to do it
for different platforms (Vagrant, Xen, KVM)

NOTE: About how to install Packer, you can go directly to the 
https://www.packer.io/intro/getting-started/install.html[Packer installation] page. TLDR if
your are a Linux user you can download the binary directly and make it available in your shell PATH.

=== Packer builders

A builder in Packer describes how the image is going to be built for a
specific platform (AWS EC2, KVM, Docker...). In a Packer configuration 
file you can add as many builders as type of images you want to build.
For instance, in this post I'm only using the Qemu builder because 
my target environment is KVM.

=== Configuration file

The Packer configuration file is just a JSON file with some group of properties:

- **variables**: variable declaration. You can declare variables and default values and reference
those variables along the rest of the configuration.
- **builders**: As I mentioned in the beggining a builder represents the way in which the image machine
is going to be built in a given environment (qemu in here)
- **provisioners**: Provisioners can be used to configure or install new software in the image after booting (e.g Ansible as provisioner).
- **post-processors**: Post processors run after the image is built and provisioners have finished (e.g uploading the image to a remote registry).

=== Example

My hello world example is to build a Debian 10 VM for Qemu environment. The structure of the project is:
example is:

[source, shell]
.structure
----
+--http
|   +
|   |
|   +---debian-10.cfg
|
+--debian-10.json
----

- **debian-10.json**: Packer configuration file
- **debian-10.cfg**: Debian 10 preseed file

The Packer entry file is **debian-10.json**, is where the builders, provisioners, post-processors and variables
are set:

[source, json]
..debian-10.json
----
include::{sources}/debian-10.json[]
----

This Packer file configures just one builder, which builds a Qemu compatible Debian 10 qcow2 image with
the following properties:

[source, json]
.builder basic properties
----
"type": "qemu",
"vm_name": "debian-10",
"headless": true,
----

The builder is of type **qemu**, the resulting virtual machine will be named **debian-10** and
the installation is automated so I don't need to see it working (**headless**).

[source, json]
.base image retrieval
----
"iso_url": "https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-10.1.0-amd64-netinst.iso",
"iso_checksum": "7915fdb77a0c2623b4481fc5f0a8052330defe1cde1e0834ff233818dc6f301e",
"iso_checksum_type": "sha256",
----

I'm taking an official image from the Debian site (**iso_url**), and to make sure the image hasn't been tampered
I'm going to check its signature (**iso_checksum**) with the right algorithm (**iso_checksum_type**).


[source, json]
.phisical features
----
"memory": "2048",
"disk_size": "5000",
"cpus": 2,
----

When building the image, it will have 2GB of **memory** a **disk_size** of 5G and 2 **cpus**.

[source, json]
.ssh information
----
"ssh_username": "admindebian",
"ssh_password": "Pa55w0rd",
"shutdown_command": "echo 'Pa55w0rd'|sudo -S shutdown -h now",
"ssh_timeout": "12m",
----

The ssh information is required to help Packer to communicate with the image.

WARNING: It's always a good idea to add a **ssh_timeout**, a connection loss or
a timeout due to rebooting can happen at any time.

=== Preseed files

Because we want to automate the whole installation step-by-step process, we would like to
pass like a guide to the installer in order to tell it what to do. That's what the preseed
files are for. In order to make the installer aware of the preseed file we need:

- To tell Packer the directory where the preseed file is by setting the **http** property
- To pass the **url** property to the boot command with the whole url where the preseed file is going to be available

[source, json]
.debian-10.json
----
{
    ...
    "http_directory": "http",
    "boot_command": [
        ...
        "url=http://{{ .HTTPIP }}:{{ .HTTPPort }}/debian-10.cfg ",
        "<enter>"
    ]
}
----

In a preseed file you would find instructions for every step: networking, root account, setting the
system locale, timezone... For example, here's a sample of the preseed file for my Debian 10 image:

[source, properties]
.debian-10.cfg
----
include::{sources}/http/debian-10.cfg[tags=sample]
----

NOTE: Every OS may need a different type of preseed file. Checkout some examples in this
 https://github.com/kaorimatz/packer-templates[Github repository]

=== Packer provisioners

Ok, once we've built the image, we may want to install some packages, or configure some
services...etc,  that is to say to provision the image. You can reference several ways
and tools to provision the image: Ansible, Puppet, shell script... For this example I'm
using a simple shell script.

[source, json]
.provisioners example
----
"provisioners": [
    {
        "type": "shell",
        "scripts": [
            "scripts/update.sh"            
        ]
    }
]
----

As you may notice, the **provisioners** property is a list with possible provisioners. I'm
just using the type **shell** pointing to a list with just one shell script. This script
will be loaded to the built image and executed there (by default is copied to /tmp). The
**update.sh** script is just updating apt indexes:

[source, bash]
----
include::{sources}/scripts/update.sh[]
----

=== Packer and Vault

- https://www.packer.io[Packer] is an open source tool for creating identical machine images for multiple 
platforms from a single source configuration. 
- https://www.vaultproject.io[Vault] Secure, store and tightly control access 
to tokens, passwords, certificates, encryption keys for protecting secrets and other sensitive 
data using a UI, CLI, or HTTP API.

NOTE: I wrote a little intro about Packer at link:/blog/2019/09/packer_intro.html[previous post]. 

When building Packer images you have to handle secrets such as the root user/password of your new image, and
you don't want to keep that kind of sensible data neither hardcoded in a versioned template, nor unversioned
in your local machine. Vault could be a great partner for keeping and managing that kind of things under
control. I'm showing an example about creating some secrets inside Vault and reference them in a Packer
template so that Packer can ask Vault for those secrets when building a new image.

=== Startup Vault

First of all start up a new Vault instance. I'm starting Vault in development mode:

[source, shell]
.startup vault (dev)
----
[mario@localhost$] vault server -dev
...
WARNING! dev mode is enabled! In this mode, Vault runs entirely in-memory                     
and starts unsealed with a single unseal key. The root token is already                                                                                                                       
authenticated to the CLI, so you can immediately begin using Vault.                                                                                                                           
                                                                                               
You may need to set the following environment variable:                 
                                                                                               
    $ export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'               
                                                                                               
The unseal key and root token are displayed below in case you want to
seal/unseal the Vault or re-authenticate.                                                      
                                                                                               
Unseal Key: wYZVb0bkahGPeVdyjGWBs/UPZ4qoSLFXhubpsl7fiEM=                
Root Token: s.3vMd4W3jEpGtbp5no1IpUt3d                                                         
                                                                                                                                                                                              
Development mode should NOT be used in production installations!
...
----

IMPORTANT: Not use this development mode in production

Open another shell and export **VAULT_ADDR** and **VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID** (Root Token).
That'll enable Packer to access Vault values in this shell:

[source, shell]
----
[mario@localhost$] export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
[mario@localhost$] export VAULT_DEV_ROOT_TOKEN_ID='s.3vMd4W3jEpGtbp5no1IpUt3d'
----

=== Create a Packer secret store

Next step is to create a secrets store of type **kv** in the path **packer**

[source, shell]
.enable secret store
----
[mario@localhost$] vault secrets enable -path=packer kv
----

Not I can store the **username** and **password** I'm going to use in my
Debian VM later on.

[source, shell]
.enter secrets in new path
----
[mario@localhost$] vault write packer/debian username=admindebian password=supersecret
----

Lets make sure both value are in there

[source, shell]
.checking values
----
[mario@localhost$] vault get kv packer/debian
----


=== Reference your secrets in templates

Now that we've entered our secrets in Vault, we can reference those
values in our Packer templaes:

[source, json]
.use vault values in templates
----
include::{sources}/debian-10-vault.json[]
----

- You can only reference vault values as default values **in variables block**
- You have to use the **vault function** with the secret store name and the name of the value stored

[source, json]
.vault values as default variable values
----
"variables": {
    "username": "{{ vault `packer/debian` `username` }}",
    "password": "{{ vault `packer/debian` `password`}}"
}
----

- You can then use the **user function** in the rest of the template

[source, json]
.user function
----
...
"ssh_username": "{{ user `username` }}"
...
----


=== Profit

Now if you execute a Packer build, build will ask Vault to give it the secrets referenced
in its templates, so that you don't have to be worried about storing or managing that kind
of information.

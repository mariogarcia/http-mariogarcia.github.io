=== Terraform/KVM/libvirt

https://www.terraform.io/[Terraform] is a tool for provisioning,
and managing infrastructure. It describes a given infrastructure
as code, maintains the state of the infrastructure described so
that an administrator can manage it, adding, removing or updating
resources. One of the things I like the most about Hashicorp is that all its
products are one executable binary in Linux. That makes incredibly
easy to start using them. In this case I just had to download the `tar.gz` file containing
the executable, put the executable in my shell PATH, and checking
that it works just executing in my shell:

[source, shell]
----
[mario@localhost]$ terraform --version
----

https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page[KVM] or Kernel Virtual Machine is a virtualization environment consisting on a Linux
Kernel module capable of providing a virtualization infrastructure. You have to check how to install KVM in your Linux distribution,
in Fedora 30 is as easy as executing:

[source, shell]
----
[mario@localhost]$ sudo dnf install @virtualization
----


The `@virtualization` alias is just an aggregation of the required
packages to start using KVM in your local machine. You can check
which packages are included by executing:

[source, shell]
----
[mario@localhost]$ dnf group info virtualization
----


https://libvirt.org/[Libvirt] is a virtualization API, meaning an
API able to interact with different virtualization environments such
as KVM, Xen...

=== Terraform libvirt provider

Most of the time Terraform is well known for using it in cloud environments such as AWS, Azure,
Alibaba... but the truth is that it has integrations with more than 90 types of environments thanks
to Terraform's https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/index.html[providers]. Unfortunately 
among those official providers there's none for KVM. But don't worry there's an amazing project
providing us with the provider we need.

https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt[Terraform libvirt provider] as its Github repository says is: "Terraform provider to provision infrastructure with Linux's KVM using libvirt".

NOTE: Nowadays because Terraform libvirt provider is not an official provider it's to be installed manually in your system. The last
release https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt/releases[has binaries] for some Linux distributions. Anyway you can always
https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt#building-from-source[build it from source] and then 
https://github.com/dmacvicar/terraform-provider-libvirt#installing[install the resulting binary] which happens to be what I did.

=== Hello KVM

The first Terraform file just creates a Debian 10 VM in
my local KVM. The image is a `qcow2` image file created with
https://www.packer.io/intro/[Packer] another Hashicorp tool
for creating images (not only VMs but also Docker images as well). A simple Terraform template contains **providers** and **resources**:

- A **provider** is an abstraction over the final environment, and
- A **resource** is a part of the infrastructure we want to create.

[source, ruby]
.sample structure
----
provider "libvirt" { # <1>
    ...
}

resource "libvirt_volume" "os_image" { # <2>
    ...
}

resource "libvirt_domain" "new_vm" { # <3>
    ...
}
----

<1> The provider for dealing with libvirt compatible environments
<2> A resource representing a volume in a VM
<3> A resource representing the VM we want to create

Lets see a real example creating a Debian 10 VM in my local KVM
environment.

[source, ruby]
.hello_world.tf
----
include::{sources}/simple/hello_world.tf[]
----

<1> **Declaring the provider**: There provider knows about the underlying infrastructure. In this case, because we're creating
VMs in an libvirt compatible environment, we're using the libvirt
provider. This time is pointing to my local environment.
<2> **Declaring which image to use**: The base of the VM created in the infrastructure is going to be a Debian 10. The image can be
created in several ways. I've created mine using Hashicorp's Packer.
<3> **Describing how everything stick together**: Once I've
described the different resources that I'm going to use, I should
create a domain resource.  The domain glues all the previous resources.

Before doing anything we need **to init the project**. This
is required because Terraform checks whether it has the providers
required to accomplish the plan:

[source, shell]
----
[mario@localhost]$ terraform init

Initializing the backend...

Initializing provider plugins...

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.
----

Then, altough is not mandatory, but in order to keep all templates with the
same format I like to pass the formatter. This will format all
Terraform files found in the current directory.

[source, shell]
----
[mario@localhost]$ terraform fmt
----

Before executing the terraform plan, I can validate the template:

[source, shell]
----
[mario@localhost]$ terraform validate
----

Finally we can execute our plan:

[source, shell]
----
[mario@localhost]$ terraform apply

An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # libvirt_domain.new_vm will be created
  + resource "libvirt_domain" "new_vm" {
      + arch        = (known after apply)
      + emulator    = (known after apply)
      + fw_cfg_name = "opt/com.coreos/config"
...
Plan: 2 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: 
----

The **apply** command shows you the resources it's going to 
apply and requires from you to confirm before going any
further. Only if you write **yes** will continue. You can then 
check that the VM is up and running. I'd normally open the
Virtual Machine Manager desktop app.

image::2019/09/terraform_kvm/hello_kvm_running.png[link="/img/2019/09/terraform_kvm/hello_kvm_running.png", role="external", window="_blank", width="550"]

At this point Terraform updates the state of your infrastructure so
that if wanted to destroy everything it knows what to do:

[source, shell]
----
[mario@localhost]$ terraform destroy
----

After confirming again that you want to destroy your infrastructure
Terraform will take over and destroy it.

=== Variables


At some point we may like to reuse our templates. A first step
could be setting some variables in the template and passing their
values when executing the plan. We can change our initial template
and declare some variables:

[source, ruby]
.hello_world.tf
----
include::{sources}/variables/hello_world.tf[tags=variables]
----

Once we have declared the variables we can substitue the literals
by the variables. You only have to add the prefix `var.` and the
name of the variable in the part of the template you want to use it.

[source, ruby]
.hello_world.tf
----
include::{sources}/variables/hello_world.tf[tags=resources]
----

Finally you can execute your plan and pass the variables along
with the command. Here for example we would like to create a VM in a remote KVM host.

[source, shell]
.passing variables values to terraform apply
----
[mario@localhost]$ terraform apply \
    -var="kvm_destination_uri=qemu+ssh:root@my.cloud.example.com/system" \
    -var="hostname=firewall" \
    -var="memory=1024" \
    -var="image_path=/tmp/myimage.qcow2"
----

Or writing those key=value in a variables file:

[source, ruby]
.hello_world.tfvars
----
kvm_destination_uri="qemu+ssh:root@my.cloud.example.com/system"
hostname="firewall"
memory="1024"
image_path="/tmp/myimage.qcow2"
----

And pass the file name to the Terraform apply command:

[source, shell]
.passing variables filename to terraform apply
----
terraform apply -var-file=hello_world.tfvars
----

NOTE: If you don't pass the variables to the command line nor
passing a variables file, still Terraform could prompt you to give
it the values for the required variables.

=== Modules

One step further when reusing our templates is to create modules. A module represents a set of resources and variables that are meant to be used together. The basic structure of a module directory is to have three files: -

- `main.tf`: where the resources are declared
- `variables.tf`: where the variables are declared
- `outputs.tf`: where the output variables are declared

Please notice that `variables.tf` is where the definition of the
variables are declared, not the values, that, again could be
in a different file `.tfvars`.

I'm creating the following folder structure:

[source, ditaa]
----
+---modules
       +-----debian (module)
       |        +-----main.tf
       |        |
       |        +-----variables.tf
       |
       +-----myplan.tf    
----

- This structure **modules/debian** represents a module called **debian**. 
- The Terraform plan **myplan.tf** will be reusing the **debian** module. 

In order to follow using the previous example:

- Split the previous version of the terraform file **hello_world_variables.tf** 
- Put the variables in the **variables.tf**
- Put the resource declaration in the **main.tf**. 
- These two files will be located at **modules/debian**

[source, ruby]
.variables.tf
----
include::{sources}/modules/debian/variables.tf[]
----

[source, ruby]
.main.tf
----
include::{sources}/modules/debian/main.tf[]
----

Finally I can reference the **debian** module in my new plan overriding
any declared variable in the module.

[source, ruby]
.myplan.tf
----
include::{sources}/modules/myplan.tf[]
----

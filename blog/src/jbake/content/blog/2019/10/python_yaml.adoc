:summary: Using YAML in Python with PyYAML library

== Introduction

I'd like to load an Yaml file and get values from it 
**without using a plain Python dictionary** syntax (which 
I don't like much) but also **without having to map the yaml structure to classes** 
in order to access values in a property invocation style (e.g.: a.b.c)
Finally I'd like also to **load different config files depending on the environment**.

== Using PyYaml and addict

The library chosen to load yaml was https://pyyaml.org/[PyYaml].
PyYaml works really straight forward, it loads a yaml
file and returns a Python dictionary. The problem
with Python dictionaries is that the syntaxis
required to access a deep node in the tree
structure is a little bit verbose.

[source, python]
.deep node access
----
config['auth']['fields']['username']
----

On the other hand, I was looking more for something like:

[source, python]
.deep node access
----
config.auth.fields.username
----

In order to achieve the required property-like syntax
I found https://github.com/mewwts/addict[Addict].

[source, python]
.YamlConfigLoader
----
include::{sources}/ycl.py[]
----
<1> loads yaml with PyYaml to get a Python dictionary
<2> converts a Python dictionary to an Addict dictionary

Now lets say I have my app config file `config.yml`:

[source, yaml]
----
include::{sources}/config.yml[]
----

We can access configuration properties using the property-dot syntax:

[source, python]
----
include::{sources}/test_ycl.py[tags=simple]
----

== Environments

It make sense in many projects to load different properties depending
on the environment we're deploying the application to. Lets see how
our code looks like when adding environment as a parameter:

[source, python]
.YamlConfigLoader
----
include::{sources}/ycl_env.py[]
----

Now our application may use some system environment variable to receive
the name of the environment the app is going to use:

[source, python]
.using test environments
----
include::{sources}/test_ycl_env.py[tags=environment]
----

== Using system environment variables

It's more and more common to deploy applications as containers. In this kind
of environments usually some configuration properties are passed as 
system environment variables. Can we create our yaml file with
some values taken from system environment variables ? 

PyYaml to the rescue!. Here we have the **config-env.yml** file with 
that idea in mind:

[source, yaml]
.config-env.yml
----
include::{sources}/config-env.yml[]
----

Thanks to PyYaml we can get the values marked with **!env** and 
process them to get the value from system environment variables. 
Moreover, look at the logging configuration, we can also 
provide a default value following the syntax:

[source, yaml]
----
key: !env VARIABLE:default_value
----

In order to make it work, we're adding a constructor, which is 
basically a yaml directive processor responsible for transforming
the values found in a yaml node after a specific directive. 
The constructor is applied globally to PyYaml so you can 
add the constructor anywhere in your code via the 
**add_constructor** function. And the use the previous
version of **YamlConfigLoader**:

[source, python]
.adding constructor
----
include::{sources}/ycl_env_var.py[tags=processing_variables]
----
<1> checks whether it has a default value or not
<2> if there is a default value tries to resolve env variable if not returns default value
<3> if there is not a default value tries to resolve env variable

This way we can test the whole thing with the previous **config-env.yml**:

[source, python]
.using directives
----
include::{sources}/test_ycl_env_var.py[tags=env_variables]
----

WARNING: When calling to `yaml.load(...)` make sure you're using the `yaml.Loader` loader as  https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml/issues/266[described here], otherwise directive processing
wont' work

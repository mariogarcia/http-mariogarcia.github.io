:summary: How to integrate TestContainers, SqlAlchemy and Pytest fixtures
:summary_image: test.png


== Intro

I've been a Java programmer for a very long time, but nowadays I'm involved 
in a Python project at work. One of the things I was missing from the Java
ecosystem was https://www.testcontainers.org/[TestContainers]. Long story short 
Testcontainers is a project enabling your project to run Docker containers 
for integration testing purposes. It turns out there's a port for 
Python and I'd like to figure out how to use it.

== The challenge

I'm creating a persistence layer with SQLAlchemy and I'd like to
use TestContainers:

- to **startup** a PostgreSQL container
- to **create the schema**
- to **run the tests** against the database
- to **truncate all tables** before running each test
- to **stop the database** at the end of the test suite (end of pytest session)

NOTE: The source code of this entry can be found at https://github.com/mariogarcia/mariogarcia.github.io/tree/working/sources/2019/10/pytest_testcontainers[Github]

Here's my Pipfile:

[source, python]
.Dependencies
----
include::{sources}/Pipfile[]
----

Notice that althoug I've added bonth **pg8000** or **psycopg2**. I'm
only using the latter in this example. There's a note about 
why at the end of the blog entry.

== Repository

I'm creating a repository which wraps the calls to the SQLAlchemy session.
In a Python project, or at least what I'm seeing lately in some Python projects, 
the SQLAlchemy session is created statically somewhere from the configuration file 
and repositories import that reference and use it. The problem with that 
is that TestContainers by default creates a Docker container 
with your database with a **random port** meaning that you won't know all 
the connection details until the container is running. Bottom line, 
the cleanest solution I could think of was dependency injection via class 
constructor injection. 

NOTE: Although by default TestContainers look for a random port by default
you can specify one port explicitly.  

This is how the repository may look like:

[source, python]
.repository with injected session
----
include::{sources}/blog/repositories.py[]
----

== Pytest fixtures (conftest.py)

Next step is to optimize the creation and disposal of the database. Basically I don't
want to create an instance of the database per each test function, that would be such
a waste. Instead I would like to **create an instance of the database spanning the whole
pytest session** and eventually shutdown the database. Apart from that, once the database 
is up and running I need to **create a session and pass it to every test in case they may need it** 
for injecting it to, for instance, a repository. So the idea is:

- to start the container
- to create the session with the container details
- to inject the session in every test so that it can be used to initialize the repository

In order to do that I'm using https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.html[Pytest fixtures]
which will help me reusing some parts among my tests (SQLAlchemy session) and run the Docker 
container in a more efficient way (One database instance for all my tests). There're several
places where you can put your fixtures so that test can be aware of them. I'm using the
**conftest.py** file to put all my fixtures there.

NOTE: Although one `conftest.py` file at the top of your project modules can be visible
to all your tests, you can also use one `conftest.py` file 
https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/writing_plugins.html#conftest-py-plugins[per directory]

These are the required imports to create my database session fixture:
[source, python]
.imports
----
include::{sources}/blog/conftest.py[tag=imports]
----

=== Session fixtures

Session fixtures are shared among all tests during a Pytest execution. So it makes sense to
create a fixture starting up the Docker container, and shutting it down once the session
ends.

[source, python]
.fixtures for pytest session and per function
----
include::{sources}/blog/conftest.py[tags=session]
----

<1> Create and start the PostgreSQL container (9.5)
<2> Create database session from container's detail
<3> Recreate database schema
<4> Create a session finalizer to stop the container once the session ends
<5> Add the finalizer to pytest
<6> Returns the database session. That will inject the database session in whatever function demanding it

NOTE: An alternative option for executing teardown code is to make use of the addfinalizer method of the 
request-context object to register finalization functions. That's why we declare the `request` parameter
in our fixtures, to be able to get the request-context object.

Dependency injection also works with session fixtures theirselves. If you would like
to provide a pytest fixture that requires a previous configured pytest session fixture
you only have to declare the dependency as a fixture parameter:

[source, python]
.injecting fixtures as parameters in another fixture
----
include::{sources}/blog/conftest.py[tags=session_factories]
----

Here to create some factories to create domain objects in my tests I
need the configured database session. Declaring the dependency as
a parameter will execute first the dependency and then pytest will
inject it in this fixture.

=== Function fixtures

Something I'd like to happen before I'm running a new test is to make sure all data from
other tests has been erased prior to run the current test. Therefore it seems like I good
idea to create a function fixture that truncates all tables before each new test execution.

[source, python]
.fixtures for pytest session and per function
----
include::{sources}/blog/conftest.py[tags=functions]
----

<1> injecting database session from previous pytest session fixture
<2> truncating all tables from schema
<3> create a finalizer function to commit and close session after each test
<4> add the finalizer function to pytest lifecycle to happen at the end of each test

== Tests

Now that the database is running and the database session is created thanks
to the pytest fixtures we just created, we can use them in our tests, just
declaring them as test parameters.

[source, python]
.tests using db session and factories
----
include::{sources}/blog/test_repositories.py[]
----

== Improvements

Well, maybe to be coherent with the rest of the application, I could create
a test configuration file, and fullfil the container startup configuration
with configuration values there. Most of the connection parameters are
available programatically when bootstraping a PostgreSQL container.

WARNING: In TestContainers 2.5 the PostgreSQL connection dialect is
hardcoded to `psycopg2+postgres` if you'd like to change it to, for example,
**pg8000** you'll have to inherit from `PostgresContainer` and 
overwrite the `get_connection_url` function.

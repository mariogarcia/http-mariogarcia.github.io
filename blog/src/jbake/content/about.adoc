Hi, my name is **Mario Garcia** and I'm a software developer. You can
find some of the code I'm working on at
https://github.com/mariogarcia[Github]. In order to keep up with
things happening in the tech world I normally use
https://twitter.com/marioggar[Twitter]. In case you're interested in
hiring me, you can reach me at
https://www.linkedin.com/in/mario-garcia-software-developer[Linkedin]

Because the best way of learning something it trying to explain it to
others, this blog is my way to explain everything I try to learn.

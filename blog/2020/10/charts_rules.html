<p>When trying to explain some data insights to somebody other than us, it requires, more often than not, some visual representation. The are several types of charts and an even greater number of customizations. It&#8217;s important to know which types fit best with the data at hand. Although it seems a pretty straighforward task, there&#8217;re plenty of examples of chart misuse, sometimes people had their heart in the right place, but unfortunately, sometimes misleading is done to confuse the viewer on purpose. At least I think it&#8217;s important to know if we&#8217;re in one group or the other.</p>

I&#8217;m reviewing each of these rules by making my own <strong>good vs bad</strong> examples. Although the visualization library I&#8217;m using is <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a> these rules should hold when using any other visualization tool.</p>

<h3 id="know_your_audience">Know your audience</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea behind this rule is that depending on the people we&#8217;re targeting we should add more or less information to our charts. It has to do with the context the audience has before seeing the data visualization.</p>

The more the audience is used to the data you&#8217;re showing, the less information is necessary to add to the visualization.

<p>Ok, imagine your boss entering the room with the chart on the left and yelling  <em>Have you seen these numbers ? I&#8217;m really worried</em>. You may think the man didn&#8217;t get his pills on time this morning right ? What are those numbers, what do they mean ? Your boss is showing something to an audience that doesn&#8217;t know the context, <strong>he didn&#8217;t realize that the audience he&#8217;s talking to needs more information, more context</strong>. If he only had added more information to the chart, maybe you could have had a chance. What about the chart on the right, with more information ?</p>

<p>By default most visualization libraries normally use a subset that can be used in a wider range of cases.

Now on the right, is the same data visualized using a <strong>customized horizontal bar plot</strong>. Numbers and labels for every type makes a <strong>better use of the space</strong>. Also <strong>colors have been changed</strong> to maximize the contrast and make it easier to read. A little bit more about the color in the next section.</p>

<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s difficult to figure out which chart will fit best our message, and is in these situations when we are tempted to improvise and create new types of visualizations.

<p>The main reason is that there&#8217;re tons of scientific documents written by really smart people out there, showing hundreds of ways of visualizing data and it&#8217;s very likely that some of these works will fit somehow in our problem if not perfectly. <strong>Avoid reinventing the wheel</strong>, and remember that <strong>people is more likely to have some exposure to pre-existent scientific visualizations</strong> helping them to avoid the effort of understanding a new way of visualizing data plus the message behind the chart.</p>

<p>However I would like to differenciate between the concept of libraries and tools. In the present article I&#8217;m using <a href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib</a> which is a Python library for data visualization but it&#8217;s been used inside a <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> notebook. <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> is a tool, but in the sense of a full featured environment where I can integrate the data I&#8217;m using with some analitic tools with some visualization libraries to show the result of my findings. Another example of such type of tool could be <a href="https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/">Weka</a> which is another tool for loading, analyzing and visualizing data, or <a href="http://beakerx.com/">BeakerX</a> which is the Java version of Jupyter. Of course this section will be incomplete without mentioning the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R project</a>, which could be considered as well a full featured data-oriented environment.</p>
